# Addia Tutors: Tutoring Services
Welcome to the GitHub repository for my personal tutoring website! This site serves as the central hub for potential and existing clients to learn more about my tutoring services, get in contact, and access essential information.

## Features
Currently, the website includes:
- Tutor Profile: Detailed information about me and the tutoring services I offer.
- Contact Form: An easy way for potential clients to reach out and for existing clients to make referrals.

## Built With
No special frameworks or libraries are used, keeping the website minimal and straightforward.
- HTML
- CSS

## Future Plans
I am planning to expand the website's functionality by:
- Adding a booking system to schedule sessions directly through the website (online tutoring only).
- Learning JavaScript to enhance interactivity and user experience.
